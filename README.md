# Nano Git

A minimal Git implementation for educational purposes.

Implemented as part of the course "Algorithms and Data Structures" in the summer semester 2024 at the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences in Bocholt.

The goal of this implementation is not to implement all the functions of the Git CLI, but to implement some of the basics described in the document.

## Usage

You can download precompiled binaries for Windows and Linux from the [releases page](https://github.com/timokoessler/nano-git/releases).

## Development

Node.js v20 or higher is required to build and run the project. After cloning the repository, you can install the dependencies with `npm i` and test the project with `npm run dev`.
